# Project - Automotive Market Analysis

This project aims to explore, prepare, and model data related to the automotive market to provide valuable insights to an automotive company looking to enter a new market. The project is divided into three phases: exploratory data analysis, data preparation, and modeling and evaluation.

## Project Description

### Problem Statement

Our data science team has been hired by a prominent automotive company to analyze the automotive market of a new region they intend to enter. To achieve this, we have collected data on vehicles available in the current market, including features and retail prices. The objective is to understand the characteristics of high-end and low-end vehicles to price the vehicles properly in the market.

### Project Structure

The project is divided into the following phases:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preparation
3. Model Implementation and Evaluation

### Project Files

- `EDA, Modelo y Evaluacion.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains all the code and steps taken in the project, from data exploration to the implementation of regression and classification models.

## Results

### Exploratory Data Analysis

During the EDA phase, we conducted a detailed analysis of the data to better understand the automotive market. We explored descriptive statistics, visualized distributions, and identified trends in the data.

### Data Preparation

In the data preparation stage, we performed data cleaning and transformation. This included handling missing values, creating dummy variables, and standardizing features.

### Implemented Models

We have implemented two models:

1. Regression Model: We built a linear regression model to predict the prices of vehicles in the market. We evaluated the model's accuracy and made predictions.
2. Classification Model: We implemented a classification model to distinguish between high-end and low-end vehicles using the median price as a cutoff point. We evaluated classification metrics and made predictions.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `EDA, Modelo y Evaluacion.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment or an online notebook platform.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each step of the project.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
